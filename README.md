Clustering benchmarks:

You should not use k-means clustering on a dataset containing mixed datatypes. Rather, there are a number of clustering algorithms that can appropriately handle mixed datatypes. Some possibilities include the following:

1) Partitioning-based algorithms: k-Prototypes, Squeezer
2) Hierarchical algorithms: ROCK, Agglomerative single, average, and complete linkage
3) Density-based algorithms: HIERDENC, MULIC, CLIQUE
4) Model-based algorithms: SVM clustering, Self-organizing maps

If you would like to learn more about these algorithms, the manuscript 'Survey of Clustering Algorithms' written by Rui Xu offers a comprehensive introduction to cluster analysis.
